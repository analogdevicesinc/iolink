IO-Link is a standardized point-to-point connection down at the edge layer of the factory automation pyramid.

The **iolink** Python package allows access to IO-Link devices from within Python, 
by providing a common abstraction layer to different IO-Link adapters.

Note that for now, only the iqLinkÂ® device is supported and only under Windows.

The following example prints the product name of a connected device, by reading out the standard ISDU parameter 0x12.

.. code-block:: python

   import iolink
   
   # create a port instance
   with iolink.get_port(interface='iqLink') as port:
       # change state of the connected device to "Operate"
       port.change_device_state_to('Operate')
       # read standard ISDU
       isdu_0x12_data = port.read_device_isdu(0x12)
       # convert the received bytes object that's supposed
       # to be an ASCII string to a standard Python 3 string
       # and print the result
       print(f'Product Name: {isdu_0x12_data.decode("utf8")}')
